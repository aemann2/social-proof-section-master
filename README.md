A fun challenge that turned out to be pretty straightforward. The only thing I struggled with was positioning the star SVG files in the `aside` sections. I figured out a way to do it with `background-repeat`, but I think there's probably a better way. Setting the fonts and margins in REM units really helped resize everything in the media queries, since all I really had to do was change the `font-size` percentage and container `width`.

## The challenge

> Your challenge is to build out this social proof section and get it looking as close to the design as possible. You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
